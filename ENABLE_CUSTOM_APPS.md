# Enable Custom Apps in Shopify

If you don't see a "Custom apps" section, you may need to enable it first. Here are several methods:

## Method 1: Enable Through "Develop apps" Button

1. **In Settings → Apps and sales channels**
2. **Click the "Develop apps" button** at the top (grey button, next to "Shopify App Store")
3. **You might see**:
   - A page asking to "Allow custom app development"
   - Or it might take you to a page where you can create apps
4. **If you see "Allow custom app development"**, click it
5. **Then you should see** the custom apps section

## Method 2: Direct URL

Try going directly to this URL:
```
https://6tfp84-zr.myshopify.com/admin/settings/apps/develop
```

This should either:
- Show you the custom apps section
- Or ask you to enable custom app development

## Method 3: Check Your Plan

Some Shopify plans might have restrictions. Check:
1. **Settings → Plan**
2. **What plan are you on?**
   - Basic Shopify ($29/month) - Should have custom apps
   - Starter plan - May not have custom apps
   - Trial - Should work

## Method 4: Use Shopify CLI (Alternative)

If the web interface doesn't work, we can use Shopify CLI, but this is more complex. Let's try the other methods first.

## Method 5: Check Permissions

1. **Settings → Users and permissions**
2. **Check your account** - make sure you have:
   - Owner permissions, OR
   - Staff with full permissions

## What to Try Right Now

**Step 1**: In Settings → Apps and sales channels, click the **"Develop apps"** button at the top (the grey one, not "Shopify App Store")

**Step 2**: See what happens:
- Does it ask to enable custom app development?
- Does it show a page with "Create app"?
- Does it take you somewhere else?

**Step 3**: Tell me what you see!

## Alternative: Use Printify's Integration

Since you already have Printify connected, there might be another way:
- Printify might provide API access
- Or we can use Shopify's Buy Button instead of Storefront API

But let's try to get custom apps working first.

## Quick Test

Try this exact URL:
```
https://6tfp84-zr.myshopify.com/admin/settings/apps/develop
```

What do you see when you go there?

Let me know what happens when you click "Develop apps" in Settings → Apps and sales channels!
