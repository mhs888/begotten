# Get Storefront API Token from Dev Dashboard App

Since Shopify now uses the dev dashboard, let's get the token from the app you already created there.

## Step 1: Go to Dev Dashboard

1. **Click "Build apps in Dev Dashboard"** (or go to partners.shopify.com)
2. **Log in** if needed
3. **Find your "Storefront" app** (or "Begotten Website" app)

## Step 2: Find API Credentials

1. **Click on your app** in the dev dashboard
2. **Look for tabs or sections**:
   - **"Settings"** tab
   - **"API credentials"** section
   - **"Configuration"** tab
   - **"Overview"** tab

## Step 3: Check Settings Tab

1. **Click "Settings"** in your app (left sidebar)
2. **Look for**:
   - **"API credentials"** section
   - **"Storefront API"** section
   - **"Client credentials"** (this is different - you need Storefront API)

## Step 4: Install App to Your Store

The app needs to be installed to your store to get the Storefront API token:

1. **In dev dashboard**, go to your app
2. **Look for "Test on development store"** or **"Install"** button
3. **Install it to your store** (6tfp84-zr.myshopify.com)
4. **After installing**, the Storefront API token should be available

## Step 5: Get Token After Installation

Once installed:

1. **Go back to regular Shopify admin**
2. **Settings → Apps and sales channels**
3. **Find your app** in the installed apps
4. **Click on it**
5. **Look for "API credentials"** or **"Storefront API"**

## Alternative: Use Shopify Buy Button

If getting the Storefront API token is too complex, we can use **Shopify Buy Button** instead:
- Simpler setup
- Works with your website
- Still connects to Printify
- Less customization but easier

## What to Try Now

**In the dev dashboard:**

1. **Click on your "Storefront" app** (or whatever you named it)
2. **Click "Settings"** in the left sidebar
3. **Look for "API credentials"** or **"Storefront API"** section
4. **Check if there's a "Install" or "Test" button** to install it to your store

**OR**

1. **Go to regular Shopify admin**
2. **Settings → Apps and sales channels**
3. **Look for your app** - is it listed there?
4. **If yes, click on it** and see if API credentials are visible
