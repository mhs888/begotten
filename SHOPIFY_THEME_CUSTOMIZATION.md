# Customize Your Shopify Theme with Your Logo and Design

You have a Shopify storefront at https://www.begotten.shop and want to add your logo and design elements from the custom site.

## Option 1: Add Logo to Shopify Theme

### Step 1: Upload Your Logo

1. **In Shopify Admin**, go to **"Online Store"** → **"Themes"**
2. **Click "Customize"** on your active theme
3. **Look for "Header"** or **"Theme settings"**
4. **Find "Logo"** section
5. **Upload your logo image** (the one with "Begotten" text)
6. **Save**

### Step 2: Update Hero Text

1. **In Theme Customizer**, find **"Homepage"** or **"Sections"**
2. **Look for hero/banner section**
3. **Update the text** to: "God so loved the world, that he gave his only **begotten** Son"
4. **Make "begotten" bold** if possible
5. **Add**: "100% of profits go to charity"

### Step 3: Match Your Minimal Design

**Colors:**
- Set background to white
- Text to black
- Remove colorful elements
- Keep it minimal

**Typography:**
- Use light font weights where possible
- Add letter spacing (tracking)
- Keep it clean and minimal

## Option 2: Use Custom CSS

You can add custom CSS to match your design:

1. **In Theme Customizer** → **"Theme settings"** → **"Custom CSS"**
2. **Add CSS** to match your custom site's style

## Option 3: Keep Custom Site + Connect Domain

Since you already have the custom site built, you could:

1. **Deploy your custom Next.js site** to Vercel
2. **Connect begotten.shop domain** to Vercel
3. **Keep your exact design**
4. **Add Shopify Buy Button** for checkout

This gives you:
- ✅ Your exact custom design
- ✅ Your logo integrated
- ✅ Minimal YSL-style aesthetic
- ✅ Still connects to Shopify/Printify

## What I Can Help With

I can help you:
1. **Customize your Shopify theme** to match your design
2. **Add the logo** to Shopify
3. **Update the hero text** with your quote
4. **Add custom CSS** for minimal styling
5. **OR deploy your custom site** and connect the domain

## Quick Questions

1. **Do you want to customize the Shopify theme**, or **use your custom Next.js site**?
2. **Which theme are you using** in Shopify? (Dawn, Debut, etc.)
3. **Do you have the logo as a file** I can help you optimize?

## My Recommendation

Since you've already built a beautiful custom site with:
- Your exact minimal design
- YSL-style aesthetic
- Your logo ready to integrate
- Professional look

I'd suggest **using your custom site** and connecting `begotten.shop` to it, then adding Shopify Buy Button for checkout. This gives you the best of both worlds!

But I can help with either approach - let me know what you prefer!
