# Where to Find API Credentials Tab in Shopify

After creating your app, here's where to find the API credentials:

## Location 1: Top Tabs (Most Common)

After creating your app, look at the **top of the page** for tabs:

```
[Overview] [API credentials] [Configuration] [Webhooks]
```

- Click on **"API credentials"** tab
- This is usually the second or third tab

## Location 2: Left Sidebar

Some Shopify interfaces show it in a **left sidebar**:

- Look for a menu on the left side
- Click on **"API credentials"** or **"Credentials"**

## Location 3: In the Overview Tab

Sometimes it's in the Overview tab:

1. **Click "Overview"** tab (if you're not already there)
2. **Scroll down** the page
3. Look for a section called:
   - **"API credentials"**
   - **"Storefront API"**
   - **"API access"**

## Location 4: Configuration Section

1. **Click "Configuration"** tab
2. Look for **"Storefront API"** section
3. Click on it to see credentials

## What to Look For

Once you find it, you should see:

- **Storefront API access token** (this is what you need!)
- **Admin API access token** (you don't need this)
- **API key** and **API secret** (you don't need these)

## Step-by-Step Visual Guide

### After Creating App:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  App Name                    [Settings] │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  [Overview] [API credentials] [Config]  │ ← Click here!
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                         │
│  Storefront API access token:          │
│  [Reveal token]  shpat_abc123...        │ ← Copy this!
│                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## If You Can't Find It

### Try These:

1. **Look for "Storefront API"** text anywhere on the page
2. **Scroll down** - it might be below the fold
3. **Check all tabs** - Overview, Configuration, etc.
4. **Look for a button** that says "Reveal token" or "Show token"

## Alternative: Direct Link

If you know your app name, try going directly to:
```
https://YOUR-STORE.myshopify.com/admin/apps/[APP-ID]/api_credentials
```

But the tab method is easier!

## What You're Looking For

You need to find:
- ✅ **"Storefront API access token"**
- ✅ A button that says **"Reveal token"** or **"Show token"**
- ✅ The token itself (starts with `shpat_`)

## Still Can't Find It?

Tell me:
1. **What tabs do you see** at the top of the page?
2. **What sections** are visible on the page?
3. **Are you on the Overview tab** or another tab?

I can guide you more specifically based on what you see!
