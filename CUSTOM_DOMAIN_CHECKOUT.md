# Custom Domain Checkout - Future Possibilities

## Current Setup

Right now, your checkout goes through Shopify's checkout system using your primary domain (`bgttn.myshopify.com`). This is the standard setup for custom storefronts.

## Can Checkout Use Your Custom Domain (begotten.shop)?

**Short answer:** Yes, but it requires Shopify Plus and specific configuration.

### Option 1: Shopify Plus Custom Domain Checkout (Advanced)

**Requirements:**
- Shopify Plus plan ($2,000+/month)
- Custom domain checkout configuration
- SSL certificate setup
- DNS configuration

**How it works:**
- Shopify hosts checkout on your custom domain
- URL would be: `checkout.begotten.shop` or `begotten.shop/checkout`
- Full control over checkout branding
- Requires Shopify Plus support to set up

**Cost:** Shopify Plus subscription required

### Option 2: Branded Checkout (Current + Shopify Plus)

**Requirements:**
- Shopify Plus plan
- Checkout Extensibility features

**How it works:**
- Checkout still uses `bgttn.myshopify.com` domain
- But fully branded to match your site
- Custom fonts, colors, styling
- Can feel like it's part of your site

**Cost:** Shopify Plus subscription required

### Option 3: Keep Current Setup (Recommended for Now)

**What you have:**
- Custom storefront on `begotten.shop` (Vercel)
- Checkout on `bgttn.myshopify.com` (Shopify)
- Works perfectly, just different domain

**Benefits:**
- No additional cost
- Reliable and secure
- Standard Shopify checkout experience
- Customers understand this is normal

## Recommendation

For now, **keep the current setup**. It works well and customers are used to seeing Shopify checkout on a different domain. The checkout is secure, fast, and reliable.

**Consider custom domain checkout if:**
- You upgrade to Shopify Plus
- You have specific branding requirements
- You're doing high volume ($100k+/month)

## What You Can Do Now (Without Shopify Plus)

1. **Brand the checkout** (basic customization available on all plans)
   - Go to Shopify Admin → Settings → Checkout
   - Customize colors, fonts, logo
   - Make it match your brand

2. **Use checkout extensions** (if available on your plan)
   - Add custom fields
   - Modify checkout flow
   - Add upsells

3. **Optimize the transition**
   - Make sure your site clearly shows "Secure Checkout by Shopify"
   - Customers trust Shopify checkout
   - It's actually a benefit, not a drawback

## Summary

- **Current:** Checkout on `bgttn.myshopify.com` ✅ (Works great!)
- **Future (Plus):** Could use `checkout.begotten.shop` (Requires Shopify Plus)
- **Best practice:** Brand the checkout to match your site, keep it on Shopify domain

The domain difference is normal and customers expect it. Focus on making the checkout experience smooth and branded!
