## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Log into Printify

2. Log into your account
3. You'll see your Printify dashboard

### Step 2: Create a New Product

1. **Click "Create product"** button
   - This is usually a big button at the top of the dashboard
   - Or look in the left sidebar menu
   - Or click the **"+"** icon if you see it

2. **Select Product Type**:

3. **Choose a Product**:
   - Click on a specific t-shirt (e.g., "Gildan 64000 Unisex Softstyle T-Shirt")
   - This opens the product editor

### Step 3: Upload Your Design

1. **In the Product Editor**:
   - You'll see a preview of the t-shirt
   - Look for **"Add your design"** or **"Upload"** button
   - Usually located near the product preview

2. **Upload Front Design**:
   - Click **"Add design"** or **"Upload"** for the front
   - Select your design file (e.g., `crown-tee-front.png`)
   - The design will appear on the t-shirt preview
   - You can drag to reposition, resize, etc.

3. **Upload Back Design** (if you have one):
   - Look for **"Back"** tab or **"Add back design"** button

### Step 4: Choose Product Options

## Common Issues & Solutions

### "Publish" button is grayed out or missing
- **Solution**: Make sure you've:
  - Selected at least one color
  - Selected at least one size
  - Uploaded a design
  - Connected your Shopify store

### Can't find "Create product" button
- **Solution**: 
  - Look in the top navigation bar
  - Check the left sidebar menu
  - Try refreshing the page
  - Make sure you're logged in

### Product published but not showing in Shopify
- **Solution**:
  - Wait a few minutes (can take 1-2 minutes to sync)
  - Refresh your Shopify products page
  - Check if product is in "Draft" status (publish it in Shopify)
  - Verify Printify is still connected to Shopify

### Design looks wrong on preview
- **Solution**:
  - Make sure design file is high quality (at least 300 DPI)
  - Check design dimensions match print area
  - Adjust size/position in Printify editor
  - Use PNG with transparent background for best results

## Tips

1. **Save as Draft First**: You can save without publishing to test
2. **Preview Before Publishing**: Always check the preview looks good
3. **Test Order**: Order a sample before going live
4. **Multiple Variants**: Each color/size combination is a variant - more variants = more products to manage
5. **Product Names**: Name your products clearly (e.g., "Crown of Thorns Tee - White")

## Next Steps After Publishing

1. ✅ Product appears in Shopify
2. ✅ Product should appear on your website (if Shopify is connected)
3. ✅ Test by adding to cart
4. ✅ Place a test order to verify Printify fulfillment works
