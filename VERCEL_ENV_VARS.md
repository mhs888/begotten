# Vercel Environment Variables

Make sure these are set correctly in Vercel:

## Required Environment Variables

1. **NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOPIFY_STORE_DOMAIN**
   - Value: `6tfp84-zr.myshopify.com`

2. **NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOPIFY_STOREFRONT_ACCESS_TOKEN**
   - Value: `2dd81fc3944054a7f32d8dab48141af9`

## How to Check/Update in Vercel

1. Go to your project in Vercel dashboard
2. Click **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
3. Make sure both variables are listed
4. If keys are truncated, click to edit and verify the full name

## After Deployment

Once deployed, you'll get a URL like:
- `begotten.vercel.app` or
- `begotten-mhs888.vercel.app`

Your site should be live at that URL!
