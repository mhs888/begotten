# Get Storefront API Token from Installed App

You're in the right place! Instead of clicking "Develop apps", you need to access your app's API settings differently.

## Method 1: Click on Your App in the List

1. **In the "Installed" apps list**, find **"Begotten Website"**
2. **Click on "Begotten Website"** (the app name itself, not the three dots)
3. **Look for**:
   - **"API credentials"** tab or section
   - **"Storefront API"** section
   - **"Configure"** or **"Settings"** button

## Method 2: Use the Three Dots Menu

1. **Find "Begotten Website"** in the installed apps list
2. **Click the three dots (...)** on the right side of that app
3. **Look for options like**:
   - "API credentials"
   - "Configure"
   - "Settings"
   - "Manage"

## Method 3: Go to Settings → Apps and Sales Channels

1. **Click "Settings"** (gear icon, bottom left)
2. **Click "Apps and sales channels"**
3. **Scroll ALL the way down** to the bottom
4. **Look for a section** that says:
   - "Custom apps"
   - "Your apps"
   - Or just shows your app with configuration options
5. **Click on "Begotten Website"** there
6. **You should see API credentials**

## Method 4: Create a New Custom App (If Above Don't Work)

If you can't find API credentials for the existing app:

1. **Go to Settings → Apps and sales channels**
2. **Scroll to the very bottom**
3. **Look for "Custom apps"** section (separate from installed apps)
4. **Click "Create app"** or **"Develop apps"** (but in this section, not the top button)
5. **Name it** (e.g., "Website Storefront")
6. **Configure Storefront API scopes**
7. **Install it**
8. **Get the token**

## What to Look For

When you click on your app, you should see one of these:
- Tabs: Overview, API credentials, Configuration
- Sections: Storefront API, API credentials
- Buttons: "Configure Storefront API scopes", "View API credentials"

## Quick Test

**Try clicking directly on "Begotten Website"** in the installed apps list (not the three dots, but the app name itself).

**What do you see?** Does it show:
- App details page?
- API settings?
- Configuration options?
- Something else?

## Alternative: Direct URL

Try this URL (replace with your store name):
```
https://6tfp84-zr.myshopify.com/admin/apps/manage
```

This should show custom apps management.

## If Nothing Works

We can create a fresh custom app:
1. Settings → Apps and sales channels
2. Scroll to bottom
3. Create new custom app
4. Configure Storefront API
5. Get token

Let me know what happens when you click on "Begotten Website" in the installed apps list!
