# Shopify Theme vs Custom Website

You have two options. Here's the comparison:

## Option 1: Use Shopify Theme (Simpler) ✅

**How it works:**
- Connect domain directly to Shopify
- Choose a Shopify theme
- Customize the theme
- Products from Printify automatically show up
- Built-in checkout

**Pros:**
- ✅ Much simpler setup
- ✅ No deployment needed
- ✅ Domain connects easily
- ✅ Works with Printify automatically
- ✅ Built-in checkout (no API needed)
- ✅ Less technical maintenance
- ✅ Shopify handles hosting

**Cons:**
- ❌ Lose your custom YSL-style design
- ❌ Less control over exact look/feel
- ❌ Need to recreate your aesthetic in a theme
- ❌ Limited customization compared to custom site

**Best for:** Quick launch, less technical complexity

## Option 2: Keep Your Custom Website (More Control) ✅

**How it works:**
- Deploy your Next.js site to Vercel
- Connect domain to Vercel
- Keep your custom design
- Add Shopify Buy Button for checkout

**Pros:**
- ✅ Keep your beautiful YSL-style minimal design
- ✅ Full control over every detail
- ✅ Unique brand experience
- ✅ Professional custom look
- ✅ Exactly what you designed

**Cons:**
- ❌ More setup (deployment, DNS)
- ❌ Need to add Buy Button for checkout
- ❌ More technical maintenance

**Best for:** Custom brand experience, unique design

## My Recommendation

**If you want simplicity and quick launch:**
→ Use Shopify theme, connect domain, customize it

**If you want your custom design:**
→ Deploy your site, connect domain, add Buy Button

## Hybrid Option

You could also:
1. **Use Shopify theme** for now (get launched quickly)
2. **Keep working on custom site** in background
3. **Switch to custom site** later when ready

## What to Consider

**Your custom site:**
- Beautiful minimal design
- YSL-style aesthetic
- Professional and unique
- Already built and working

**Shopify theme:**
- Faster to launch
- Less technical
- Still looks professional
- Easy to manage

## Questions to Ask Yourself

1. **How important is the exact custom design?**
   - Very important → Keep custom site
   - Nice to have → Shopify theme is fine

2. **How quickly do you want to launch?**
   - ASAP → Shopify theme
   - Can wait a bit → Custom site

3. **How comfortable are you with technical stuff?**
