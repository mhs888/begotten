# Find Custom Apps / Develop Apps Section

You're looking at the **installed app** page, but you need to go to the **custom apps development** section. Here's how:

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Go to Settings

1. **Click "Settings"** (gear icon, bottom left)
2. **Click "Apps and sales channels"**

### Step 2: Scroll Down to Custom Apps

1. **Scroll down** on the "Apps and sales channels" page
2. **Look for a section** that says one of these:
   - **"Develop apps"**
   - **"Custom apps"**
   - **"App development"**
   - **"Your apps"** (with a "Create app" button)

### Step 3: Find Your App

1. **In that section**, you should see **"Begotten Website"** listed
2. **Click on it** (this is different from the installed app page)
3. **You should now see**:
   - API credentials
   - Storefront API configuration
   - Scopes settings

## What You're Looking For

The page should have sections like:
- **"API credentials"**
- **"Storefront API"**
- **"Configure Storefront API scopes"**
- **"Client ID"** and **"Secret"** (these are different from what you need)

## If You Don't See "Develop Apps" Section

### Option 1: Look for "Create app" Button

1. **In Settings → Apps and sales channels**
2. **Scroll all the way to the bottom**
3. **Look for a button** that says **"Create app"** or **"Develop apps"**
4. **Click it** - this will show your custom apps

### Option 2: Check URL

The URL should look like:
```
https://YOUR-STORE.myshopify.com/admin/settings/apps/develop
```

Or:
```
https://YOUR-STORE.myshopify.com/admin/apps/manage
```

### Option 3: Create New Custom App

If you can't find your existing app:

1. **Go to Settings → Apps and sales channels**
2. **Scroll to bottom**
3. **Click "Develop apps"** or **"Create app"**
4. **Create a new app**:
   - Name it (e.g., "Website Storefront")
   - Click "Create app"
   - Configure Storefront API scopes
   - Install it
   - Get the token

## What You Should See

- Tabs or sections for: Overview, API credentials, Configuration
- **"Storefront API"** section
- **"Configure Storefront API scopes"** link/button
- After configuring: **"Storefront API access token"** with "Reveal token" button

## Quick Check

**In Settings → Apps and sales channels, do you see:**

1. ✅ A section at the **bottom** that says "Develop apps" or "Custom apps"?
2. ✅ A **"Create app"** button somewhere?
3. ✅ Any section that's **separate** from the installed apps list?

**Tell me what you see at the bottom of the "Apps and sales channels" page** - that will help me guide you better!

## Alternative: Direct Navigation

Try going directly to:
```

```

(Replace with your actual store name if different)

This should take you directly to the custom apps section.
